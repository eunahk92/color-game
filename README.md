# color-game

Objective of the game is to pick the color of the target word shown from the list of colors below it.

# Acceptance Criteria

* The game should generate a random color string (ie, "green" or "blue") that is displayed in a random color. We'll cause this the current color.

* It should also generate a list of random color strings that are also displayed in random colors. We'll call this the color list.

* The user must click the *name* of the color in the color list that matches the *color* of the current color.

* Make an alert telling the user whether they chose correct or incorrect.

* After the alert, the game should reset.
